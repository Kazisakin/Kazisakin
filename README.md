# Kazi Mostofa Sakin

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick, focused on building practical software solutions. I work across full-stack development, data analysis, and automation. My current interests include machine learning, systems design, and cybersecurity. I'm actively seeking a Fall 2025 Co-op to apply and grow my skills in a real-world setting.
